<H3><A NAME="release">Release</A> 1.01</H3>
<P>This release of the <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com">Silicon Graphics</A> Flight Simulator is unsupported. We are giving it away because its fun,
and it demonstrates the potential for <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/OpenGL">OpenGL</A>-based games on the Windows platforms.</P>
<P>Flight requires Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0. Earlier versions of Windows
are not supported.</P>
<P>Flight uses the beta release of <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Products/Cosmo/opengl/cosmogl.html">Cosmo OpenGL</A>, which is included with this distribution. If you run flight on Windows
NT or on a machine which supports hardware acceleration of OpenGL, the Microsoft
version of OpenGL is used instead.</P>
<P>By default, flight temporarily changes the screen resolution to 640x480.
If you wish to run in the default resolution of your display, specify the
'-f' option and flight will not resize your display.</P>
<P>If your display is running in 256 color mode, flight automatically runs
in color-index mode. The color-index version of flight differs from the
RGB version in several ways:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The airplane models are simpler 
<LI>The instrument panels are simpler 
<LI>The foothills are not displayed 
<LI>The framerate is higher in the absence of hardware acceleration 
<LI>Fog and texture mapping are not available 
</OL>
<P>For best results on machines without hardware acceleration, change your
display settings to 256 color mode. Flight will run at higher color depths
but the framerate will be reduced.</P>
<P>This version of flight is compatible with the version shipped with Silicon
Graphics workstations, and network play between the two machine types is
supported. However, the SGI version uses UDP multicast network packets by
default, while the Windows version uses UDP broadcast packets because the
current version of Winsock does not support multicast. As a result, the
PC's will not recognize the SGI machines, but the SGI machines will see
the PC's. To work around this, you must enable UDP broadcast on the SGI
machines by running dog with the '-b' option.</P>
<P>UDP broadcasts have been known to cause problems for some older machines;
in particular, DEC VAXen grind to a halt when large numbers of UDP broadcast
packets cross its network interface.</P>

<H3><A NAME="changes">Changes</A></H3>
<P>Changes since 1.0:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Flight no longer causes some systems to hang after changing the screen resolution. 
<LI>The artificial horizon and radar now draw correctly under Windows NT. 
<LI>The instrument panel no longer flashes on the Matrox Millenium under Windows
NT. 
<LI>Pressing the left and right mouse buttons together now emulates the middle
mouse button.
